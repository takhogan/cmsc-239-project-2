          <h3> Overview </h3>
          {'Clone troopers were the main soldiers used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars right before the rise of the Empire. Although outnumbered by the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in most battles, the advantage of the clone troops lay in their ability to think creatively in battle, while also being genetically predisposed to follow orders. The Phase 1 clone troopers were the first set of clone troopers introduced to the Republic at the Battle of Geonosis, which marked the beginning of the Clone Wars conflict. Phase 1 troops had body armor most similar to that of their Mandalorian prime, Jango Fett.'}

Measuring three quarters of a kilometer in length and nearly half a kilometer across, the ship could carry up to 16,000 clone troopers and support personnel, as well as a full complement of LAAT gunships, and ATTE vehicles as well.'}
          <h4> Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry (LAAT/i) </h4>
          {'The LAAT/i was the main gunship used by the Republic for aerial support and troop transport on the battlefield. It was loaded with short range homing missiles with high powered artillery designed to take out enemy vehicles and troops on the ground. Each gunship could carry almost a full platoon as well, and were used for tactical insertions when larger transport ships could not land.'}
          <h4> All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (ATTE)</h4>
          {'First used in the Battle of Geonosis, the ATTE was one of the Republicâ€™s tank vehicles, designed both for assault of enemy installations as well as troop transport on the ground. Each tank could take a full platoon of troops, and was heavily armored with high powered cannons designed to pierce the armor of enemy ground-based vehicles.'}

          {'Phase 2 clone troopers refers both to the change in armor, as well as the fresh troops provided with the new armor from Kamino. Phase 2 clone armor distinguished itself from Phase 1 in that it was designed to better suit human bodies and supported more specialized equipment. Different from Phase 1, Phase 2 armor also did not have an internal life support system, so respirators had to be attached when there was no breathable air. Phase 2 armor replaced Phase 1 some time around the Battle of Ryloth, and was the armor used by the clones when executing Order 66 of the Jedi Purge.'}

Much larger than the Acclamator, it measured well over a kilometer in length, and over half a kilometer in width. However, much of its increased size mostly went toward its arsenal and the shift itself could only carry about 2,000 troops in addition to its 7,400 man crew. '}
          <h4> ARC-170 Starfighter </h4>
          {'The ARC-170 Starfighter was a multi-faceted heavy duty starfighter. Crewed by 3 clones, the ARC-170 contained a hyperdrive, allowing it to be used in both space battles as well as long range missions. Its heavy armament allowed for it to be used as a tactical ship, bomber, and dogfighter as well.'}
          <h4> TX-130 Saber class tank </h4>
          {'The TX-130 Saber-class tank was a highly maneuverable, fast attack tank. It was equipped with twin laser cannons, concussion missiles, and a beam turret on top. The ability for quick boosts of speed allowed for this tank to be used in quick skirmishes for tactical support, and then slip away.'}

Their tactical skills and ability to think more independently than the normal clone trooper gave them a key advantage in dangerous missions.'}
          <h4> Shock Troopers </h4>
          {'Shocktroopers were an elite force of clone that served as the troops of the Coruscant guard. Bred secretly and apart from the other clones, shocktroopers specialized in operations in urban areas. They were mostly used as a security force on Coruscant, and for riot control. Towards the end of the Clone Wars after Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Empire, they served as the imperial bodyguards for a brief time as well.'}
          <h4> Clone sharpshooters </h4>
          {'Clone Sharpshooters were a specialized variant of the standard clone trooper in the Republicâ€™s army. Since clones were bred to have the same eyesight, accuracy and steadiness of hand, the difference between the sharpshooters and regular clone troopers lay in their training. Clone snipers were given special training in flash training in order to teach them to be better snipers.'}

Originally, the imperial stormtroopers were just repurposed clones from the Clone Wars. This practiced phased out, however, after clone insurrections and stormtroopers instead became human recruits. Recruits, also known as cadets, were given rigorous training in order to get them to be battle ready for the frontlines of battle.

At the height of imperial power, the Empire had over 25,000 operating star destroyers in its navy.'}
          <h4>All Terrain Scout Transport (ATST) </h4>
          {'The ATST walker was made to be a lightweight, bipedal walker for troop tactical support, as well as to serve as the guard of larger ATAT walkers in major conflicts. The ATSTâ€™s swift pace and maneuverability meant that it could be used more easily to patrol cities under imperial control than other larger transports in the Empireâ€™s use. They were equipped with high powered blaster cannons and concussion grenade launchers.'}
          <h4>All Terrain Armored Transport (ATAT) </h4>
          {'The ATAT walker was a massive, heavily armored, four-legged combat walker used by the Galactic empire.

Not terribly different from regular stormtroopers, they distinguished themselves by wearing orange and red pauldrons.'}
          <h4> Magma Trooper </h4>
          {'Magma troopers were a special force of stormtroopers that operated in particular on volcanic worlds. Their armor was designed to withstand extremely high temperatures, and included a black pauldron and respirators as well. They were mostly used on Mustafar, Shu-Torin and Sullust.'}
          <h4>Stormtrooper sniper </h4>
